                    <h3>My programming path</h3>
                    <p>I started programming when I was about 12. Python is my first programming language (if scratch doesn't count) and only programming language until I got about 15.<br>From then, I started learning much more, such as C, C++, java, javascript, recently HTML and CSS, machine learning, data structures and algorithms.<br>I think I have graduately become more serious about coding, and it will very likely to be my future job.</p>
